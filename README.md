# Codeforces Torture

> A browser extension that blocks distracting websites until you solve a daily Codeforces problem.

No more "I'll solve problems after I check this one thing.". Open a non-Codeforces site without solving today's problem? You get a full-page overlay redirecting you straight to a randomly chosen unsolved problem from your rating range.

## Features

- **Daily Random Problem** — picks a fresh unsolved problem matching your rating range every day
- **Site Blocking** — overlays any non-Codeforces page with the problem & redirects you after 2 seconds (unless you've already solved a problem today)
- **Automatic Handle Detection** — scrapes your handle from codeforces.com if you're logged in
- **Rating Filter** — set min/max rating (rounded to nearest 100); defaults to 800–1200
- **Desktop Notifications** — get notified when a new daily problem is assigned

## Installation

### Chrome / Chromium

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `chrome/` directory

### Firefox

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
3. Select `firefox/manifest.json`

Approval pending for the extension to be released on Chrome Web Store & Firefox Add-Ons.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. The popup auto-detects your Codeforces handle if you're logged in (or enter it manually; it validates against the API)
3. Optionally adjust the rating range
4. Click **Get Problem** to immediately fetch a random unsolved problem, or wait for the daily alarm (fires 1 minute after install, then every 24 hours)

Once a problem is assigned, browsing non-Codeforces sites will redirect you to it until you submit a correct solution.

## Permissions

- `storage` — save handle, rating range, problem cache
- `alarms` — schedule daily problem refresh
- `notifications` — daily problem notification
- `tabs` — open Codeforces login / problem pages
- `<all_urls>` — inject content script & fetch from Codeforces API

## Tech

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS. No build tools, no dependencies. Compatible with Manifest V3 on both Chrome & Firefox.
